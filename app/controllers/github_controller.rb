  # The goal with most of these routes is to respond to things happening on the various GitHub repositories.
  # Each repository is set up with one or more WebHooks to the functions defined here.
  # Most of these recognize some specific thing happening in the repository and send a message to SmokeDetector,
  # which is then forwarded to SE chat.
  #
  # From a conceptual standpoint, the things we're looking to detect are:
  #  CI testing failures, and what failed
  #  CI testing success, if everything passed, but not success of individual sub-portions.
  #  Changes to either metasmoke's wiki or SmokeDetector's wiki, in order to start a new build of the Charcoal site.
  #  Creation of PRs
  #  Pushes to SmokeDetector's master branch, so we can update the deploy branch
  #  Pushes to metasmoke's master branch to update the developer info cache
  #
  # CI testing
  #   Unfortunately, keeping track of what's happening with CI testing is a bit complicated. To a significant
  #   extent, this is because there are multiple WebHooks which are fired, depending on the type of CI testing.
  #   "Statuses" WebHooks: CI testing performed by an external service (e.g. CircleCI and Travis CI).
  #     What is reported is entirely dependent on what is provided to GitHub from the external service through
  #     the GitHub API. Generally, this is status messages indicating starting and completing the testing.
  #     At least CircleCI updates status for each separate run within the suite of tests defined to be run.
  #     There are individual events which separately indicate failure, but overall success is indicated only by
  #     all expected runs resulting in "success".
  #   "Check suites" WebHooks: Fired upon completion of a suite of GitHub Actions. Indicates overall success/failure,
  #     but doesn't appear to indicate what failed. A PR is only indicated in the WebHook when the PR is created.
  #   "Check runs" WebHooks: Fired for each sub-task within a set of GitHub Actions, with an event when each run is
  #     "created" and/or "completed". The ones fired for "completed" indicate success or failure for each run.
  #     If a matrix of testing is defined, then each value in the matrix is considered a separate "run".
  #     A PR is only indicated in the WebHook when the PR is created.
  #
  #   GitHub Actions
  #     Failure of each separate run can be recognized and reported based on "failures" seen in "Check runs" WebHooks.
  #     Success of the overall suite can be recognized and reported based on "success" seen in "Check suites" WebHooks.
  #     If a push is done at the same time as a PR is created (e.g. editing a file on GitHub from which a PR is
  #       created), then two Check suites are created and run, or, at least, double the number of "Check runs" are
  #       created and executed, but we're only going to want to report success or failure once within a short time
  #       on a single commit.
  #
  #   CircleCI
  #     Failure of each separate run can be recognized and reported based on "failures" seen in "Statuses" WebHooks.
  #     Success of the overall suite can only be determined by seeing "success" in the status for all runs which
  #       are expected for a particular commit. There is no information provided as to the total number of runs
  #       which should be created per CI, so that's something we need to know a priori.
  #
  # Notes:
  #   GitHub sends an "action" parameter in some WebHooks. Its value is unavailable, due to "action" being a reserved
  #     parameter.

  # This is invoked by the route: /github/status_hook
  # GitHub fires the status WebHook when there's a status update reported to GitHub via the GitHub API.
  # It fires when an external CI service updates status (e.g. starts/finishes).
  # It is not fired for GitHub Actions. GitHub does fire this WebHook for GitHub Pages builds.
